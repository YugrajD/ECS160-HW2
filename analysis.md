The results we obtained from the LLM were subpar at best. The summaries most of the time did not make sense or described something completely different than what isssue was. The issue comparator worked in the sense that logic was there and if it was given two lists, it would return the overlapping parts, however, that never happened considering the LLM could not produce results that the comparator could work with as the results were all over the place and could never be matched together. Specifically when it came to the bug finder, it hallucinated bugs that weren't even there, it would output something but I believe the LLM just got overwhelmed and couldn't produce a good answer which then caused it to created those hallucinations and failed JSON outputs. For those reasons, I say no, the LLM could not detect any bug also reported as a Github issue.
